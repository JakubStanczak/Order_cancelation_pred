# Order_cancelation_pred

This project was created to take part in Kaggle competition, that was a part of the Machine Leraning course I took. 
The biggest profit of this exercise was working on real world data, 
what is a greatly different experience then prepared machine learning exercises.

The data comes from an online retail shop. It contains information on the client and bought goods.
The task of this project is to predict if given orders will be cancelled.

The solution presented in the notebook Order_cancellation_prediction.ipynb was good enough
to secure me 4th place in the challenge leaderboard.
